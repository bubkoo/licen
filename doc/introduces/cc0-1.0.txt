  Because copyright is automatic in most countries, the Unlicense
  is a template to waive copyright interest in software you've
  written and dedicate it to the public domain. Use the Unlicense
  to opt out of copyright entirely. It also includes the no-warranty
  statement from the MIT/X11 license.
