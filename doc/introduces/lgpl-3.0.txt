  GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0

  Version 3 of the GNU LGPL is an additional set of permissions
  to the GNU GPLv3 license that requires that derived works be
  licensed under the same license, but works that only link to
  it do not fall under this restriction.


  Permissions           Conditions             Limitations
  ● Commercial Use      ● Disclose Source      ● Hold Liable
  ● Distribution        ● License and
  ● Modification          Copyright Notice
  ● Patent Use          ● Same License
  ● Private Use


  Note: The Free Software Foundation recommends taking the additional
  step of adding a boilerplate notice to the top of each file.
  The boilerplate can be found at the end of the GNU GPLv3 license.
  Insert the word “Lesser” before “General” in all three places in the
  boilerplate notice to make sure that you refer to the GNU LGPLv3 and
  not the GNU GPLv3.
