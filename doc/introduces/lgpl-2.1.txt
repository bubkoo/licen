  Version 3 of the GNU LGPL is an additional set of permissions
  to the GNU GPLv3 license that requires that derived works be
  licensed under the same license, but works that only link to
  it do not fall under this restriction.

  ● Commercial Use      ● Disclose Source      ● Hold Liable
  ● Distribution        ● License and

  Note: The Free Software Foundation recommends taking the additional
  step of adding a boilerplate notice to the top of each file. The
  boilerplate can be found at the end of the license.
